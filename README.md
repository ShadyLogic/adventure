# DBC Adventure

Hello friends! Together we will be building a text-based adventure game for the incoming Phase 1 students. The goal of this project is two-fold:

1. To give the new students a personalized game that is fun and related to DBC
2. To give the new students a program that they will be able to understand better and better as they progress through Phase 1.

I think it would be cool to have secrets in the game that are only accessible by opening up the program and looking at the code.

Because this could turn into a large and hard-to-manage project, it is my opinion that the best way to design this project is to make it modular. Rooms / stages in the adventure should be self-contained, while the game engine itself will handle things like user input and display. It may be benneficial to use something like the MVC model for this.

I will be handling pull requests, but I am open to all suggestions. Let's make something beautiful and meaningful!
